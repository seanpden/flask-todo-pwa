NOT MEANT FOR REAL USE (maybe one day...)  
This is a simple todo application - meant only for me to learn about learn flask, progressive web apps, and related concepts. 

  
```sh
python -m venv venv  
```

```sh
<activate venv...>  
```

```sh
python -m pip install .  
```

```sh
python -m flask --app flaskdemo --debug run
```
